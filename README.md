# AI-Based-Chatbot
This is completely voice based chatbot.
And its completely working in internet based,because i have implemented google api to complete this project.
we need good speed of internet connection to use this one.
This is completely in one file we can make it front end application.

i have used python libraries like pyttsx3 which convert text to speech and another one is speechrecognition.
which we are using for recognising the speech.

so before using this one we need to install those libraries,
for pyttsx3 we need to give the command pip install pyttsx3 for python 
if we are using jupyter or anaconda we need to install by giving the command  conda install -c auto pyttsx
next one is Speech Recognition for installing this one we can install by pip install speechrecognition
for jupyter we can install by   conda install -c conda-forge speechrecognition
next i have taken wikipedia and datetime we can install like this .

its all done now.

Actually its just the demo for voice based chatbot.
we can do lot of stuffs like this what i have prepared.

now enjoy we the voice based chatbot.
