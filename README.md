# AI-Based-Chatbot
This is completely voice based chatbot.
And its completely working in internet based,because i have implemented google api to complete this project.
we need good speed of internet connection to use this one.

i have used python libraries like pyttsx3 which convert text to speech and another one is speechrecognition.
which we are using for recognising the speech.

so before using this one we need to install those libraries,

for pyttsx3 we need to give the command pip install pyttsx3 for python.

if we are using jupyter or anaconda we need to install by giving the command  conda install -c auto pyttsx

next one is Speech Recognition for installing this one we can install by pip install speechrecognition

for jupyter we can install by   conda install -c conda-forge speechrecognition

next i have taken wikipedia and datetime we can install like this .


so here i have given 3 files 1st one is define function there we have to define our main library that is pyttsx3 and speech recognizer

then we have to execute another one that is define date and time that is for difining the date and time for wishing as per the time like Good morining ,Good evening,Good afternoon.

then 3rd one i have given is statement as per customer requirement i have given the statements and logics to give the output.

its all done now.



now enjoy the voice based chatbot.

Actually its just the demo for voice based chatbot.
we can do lot of stuffs like this what i have prepared.
